/// @custom:member mustStartAtOrAfter The earliest time the ruleset can start.
/// @custom:member duration The number of seconds the ruleset lasts for, after which a new ruleset will start. A
/// duration of 0 means that the ruleset will stay active until the project owner explicitly issues a reconfiguration,
/// at which point a new ruleset will immediately start with the updated properties. If the duration is greater than 0,
/// a project owner cannot make changes to a ruleset's parameters while it is active â€“ any proposed changes will apply
/// to the subsequent ruleset. If no changes are proposed, a ruleset rolls over to another one with the same properties
/// but new `start` timestamp and a decayed `weight`.
/// @custom:member weight A fixed point number with 18 decimals that contracts can use to base arbitrary calculations
/// on. For example, payment terminals can use this to determine how many tokens should be minted when a payment is
/// received.
/// @custom:member decayPercent A percent by how much the `weight` of the subsequent ruleset should be reduced, if the
/// project owner hasn't queued the subsequent ruleset with an explicit `weight`. If it's 0, each ruleset will have
/// equal weight. If the number is 90%, the next ruleset will have a 10% smaller weight. This weight is out of
/// `JBConstants.MAX_DECAY_PERCENT`.
/// @custom:member approvalHook An address of a contract that says whether a proposed ruleset should be accepted or
/// rejected. It
/// can be used to create rules around how a project owner can change ruleset parameters over time.
/// @custom:member metadata Metadata specifying the controller-specific parameters that a ruleset can have. These
/// properties cannot change until the next ruleset starts.
/// @custom:member splitGroups An array of splits to use for any number of groups while the ruleset is active.
/// @custom:member fundAccessLimitGroups An array of structs which dictate the amount of funds a project can access from
/// its balance in each payment terminal while the ruleset is active. Amounts are fixed point numbers using the same
/// number of decimals as the corresponding terminal. The `_payoutLimit` and `_surplusAllowance` parameters must fit in
/// a `uint232`.
